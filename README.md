🚀 Aspiring Salesforce Developer

## 🌱 A Bit About Me  

- Always looking to grow and level up — especially when it comes to learning and building in tech 
- Currently diving deep into my **MSc in Informatics** at the University of Piraeus
- Completed the **Coding Factory**, a 6-month software development bootcamp by AUEB
- Spent 7 years in the **Special Forces** — now using that discipline to break into tech
- Worked as a **Data Entry Agent** at eFood — and now making the leap into software development
- I enjoy building things, solving problems, and getting better every day
